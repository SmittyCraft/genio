# genio // Contributing

There are not very many rules for contributing, but here are the few:

* **Use respectful language**
* Respect the ideas of others
* Do not make pull requests if you do not understand how to solve a Rubik's Cube
* File a bug report in the 'issues' section
* Write clean code

Of course, be careful to conform to the [license](https://github.com/SmittyCraft/genio/blob/master/LICENSE.txt "Apache Version 2.0").

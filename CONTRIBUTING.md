# geni√¥ // Contributing

There are not very many rules for contributing, but here are a few:

* **Use respectful language**
* Respect the ideas of others
* Do not make pull requests if you do not understand how to [solve a Rubik's Cube](https://solvethecube.com/ "Learn to Solve the Cube")
* File a bug report in the 'issues' section
* Write clean code
* Use the best English you can - non-English issues/pull requests will not be taken into consideration, as the repo admin only speak English.

Of course, be careful to conform to the [license](https://github.com/SmittyCraft/genio/blob/master/LICENSE.txt "Apache Version 2.0").
